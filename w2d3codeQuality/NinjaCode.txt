Ninja Code
=========

- Brevity is the soul of wit
        Make the code as short as possible. Show how smart you are.

        Dont not scarifice code clarity for brevity.

- One-letter variables
       Do not use single letter variables as they not descriptive and difficult to search. 

- Using abbreviations
       Do not use abbreviations as they might not be understandable by others.

- Use abstract 
       It is not a good practice to use abstract names.
       There’s just no way to figure out without a good meditation!

- Attention test
       Dont try to test attentions by using almost simlilar like variable names like date and data.

- Smart synonyms
      Do not use synonyms For instance, consider function prefixes. If a function shows a message 
      on the screen – start it with display…, like displayMessage. And then if another function 
      shows on the screen something else, like a user name, start it with show… (like showName).

-Reuse names
      Reusing existing name creats confussion. so avoid them

-Underscores for fun
      Underscores makes the code even more fragile and increases the probability of future errors.

-Show your love
      Dont use names to show love to your work like super, nice etc. you code will lose details.

- Overlap outer variables
      Using same names for variables inside and outside a function is not recommened.
      
-Side-effects everywhere!
      Using same names for variables inside and outside a function is not recommened.
