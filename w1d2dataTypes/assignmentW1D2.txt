1. What will be the output of running following code?
console.log(Number(null));  -----    0
console.log(Number(undefined));---  NaN
console.log(Boolean("0")); ---  True
console.log(Boolean(" ")); --     True

2- What will be the output of running following code?

let a = b = 2; let c = 3 - (a + b + 1); 
console.log(a--); ---   2
console.log(++c);----   -1
 console.log(a);  --   1 
console.log(c);     -1

3. What is the significance of + operator before prompt function in following code? 
?


4. What is the use of || and && operators (logical-or and logical-and) in JavaScript? Explain with an example of each. 
If applied to boolean values, the && operator only returns true when both of its operands are true (and false in all other cases), while the || operator only returns false when both of its operands are false (and true in all other cases).
The value produced by a && or || operator is not necessarily of type Boolean. The value produced will always be the value of one of the two operand expressions.

const a = 3;
const b = -2;

console.log(a > 0 && b > 0);
// expected output: false

const a = 3;
const b = -2;

console.log(a > 0 || b > 0);
// expected output: true
